# Swiss solar and wind electricity production model

This project aims to modeling the Swiss solar and wind electricity production using climatic data from
the Copernicus Climate Change Service information [CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/), electricity
data from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy [SFOE](https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/fr/home.html) and from the
entsoe transparency platform [ENTSOE](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/).
